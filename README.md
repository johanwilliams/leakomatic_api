# Leakomatic Integration for Home Assistant

This integration allows you to connect your Leakomatic water leak sensors to Home Assistant. Leakomatic is a water protection system that has been available since 2002, providing leak monitoring and automatic water shutoff capabilities for various types of properties.

- **Automatic Control**: Can automatically shut off water supply when issues are detected
- **Property Types**: Compatible with various property types including:
  - Residential properties
  - Commercial buildings
  - Construction sites
  - Industrial facilities

## Features

- Real-time updates via WebSocket connection
- Device mode monitoring and control (Home/Away/Pause)
- Quick test index monitoring
- Flow duration monitoring
- Longest tightness period monitoring
- Flow indicator monitoring
- Online status monitoring
- Signal strength monitoring
- Valve state monitoring
- Alarm state monitoring (Flow/Quick/Tightness tests)
- Device information display (model, software version, location)
- Automatic reconnection handling
- Full localization support for all sensor names and states
- Service to change device operating mode
- Button to reset alarms

## Available Entities

The integration provides the following entities:

### Sensors

- **Quick Test Index**: Displays the current quick test measurement value
  - Numerical value indicating water flow characteristics
  - Updates in real-time when quick tests are performed

- **Flow Duration**: Shows the duration of the last completed water flow
  - Measured in seconds
  - Updates when a flow event completes
  - Helps track water usage patterns

- **Signal Strength**: Shows the WiFi signal strength (RSSI) of the device
  - Measured in dBm
  - Updates in real-time through WebSocket events
  - Helps monitor device connectivity quality

- **Longest Tightness Period**: Shows the longest period of no water flow
  - Measured in seconds
  - Updates in real-time through WebSocket events
  - Helps monitor system tightness and potential leaks

### Binary Sensors

- **Flow Indicator**: Shows if water is currently flowing
  - States: On (water flowing), Off (no water flow)
  - Updates in real-time through WebSocket flow events
  - Useful for tracking active water usage and flow patterns

- **Online Status**: Shows if the device is currently online
  - States: On (online), Off (offline), Unknown (initial state)
  - Updates in real-time through WebSocket events
  - Automatically sets to "On" when receiving any activity message from the device
  - Automatically sets to "Off" when receiving a device update with is_online=False
  - Includes a last_seen attribute showing the timestamp of the last received message
  - Useful for monitoring device connectivity and troubleshooting connection issues

- **Valve**: Shows the current state of the water valve
  - States: On (valve open), Off (valve closed)
  - Updates in real-time through WebSocket events
  - Helps monitor valve operation and status

### Select Entities

- **Mode**: Allows changing the operating mode of your Leakomatic device
  - Options: Home, Away, Pause
  - Updates in real-time through WebSocket events
  - Can be used to change the device mode directly from Home Assistant

### Buttons

- **Reset Alarms**: Allows resetting all active alarms on the device
  - Located in the device configuration section
  - Useful for clearing alarm states after resolving issues

### Alarm Test Sensors

- **Flow Test**: Monitors flow alarms and provides alarm state information
  - States: Clear (0), Warning (1), Alarm (2)
  - Updates in real-time through WebSocket alarm events
  - Provides early warning of potential water flow issues

- **Quick Test**: Monitors quick test alarms
  - States: Clear (0), Warning (1), Alarm (2)
  - Updates in real-time through WebSocket alarm events
  - Helps detect and prevent water leaks

- **Tightness Test**: Monitors tightness test alarms
  - States: Clear (0), Warning (1), Alarm (2)
  - Updates in real-time through WebSocket alarm events
  - Helps detect and prevent water leaks

## Services

The integration provides the following service:

- **leakomatic.change_mode**: Change the operating mode of your Leakomatic device
  - Parameters:
    - `entity_id`: The entity ID of the Leakomatic device
    - `mode`: The new mode to set (home, away, or pause)
  - Example usage in automations or scripts:
    ```yaml
    service: leakomatic.change_mode
    target:
      entity_id: sensor.leakomatic_mode
    data:
      mode: away
    ```

## Supported Languages

This integration supports the following languages:
- English (en)
- Swedish (sv)

The integration will automatically use the language that matches your Home Assistant language settings. All sensor names, states, and UI elements will be displayed in your chosen language.

## Installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/leakomatic` directory to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Follow the configuration steps below

## Configuration

1. Go to Settings â†’ Devices & Services
2. Click "Add Integration"
3. Search for "Leakomatic"
4. Enter your email and password
5. Click "Submit"

The integration will automatically:
- Connect to your Leakomatic device

## Debug Logging

To enable debug logging for this integration, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.leakomatic: debug
```
