# Leakomatic Integration for Home Assistant

This integration allows you to connect your Leakomatic water leak sensors to Home Assistant.

## Features

- Real-time updates via WebSocket connection
- Device mode monitoring (Home/Away/Pause)
- Quick test index monitoring
- Flow duration monitoring
- Device information display (model, software version, location)
- Automatic reconnection handling
- Full localization support for all sensor names and states

## Available Sensors

The integration provides the following sensors:

- **Mode Sensor**: Shows the current operating mode of your Leakomatic device
  - States: Home (0), Away (1), Pause (2)
  - Includes device status attributes like alarm state and last seen time

- **Quick Test Index**: Displays the current quick test measurement value
  - Numerical value indicating water flow characteristics
  - Updates in real-time when quick tests are performed

- **Flow Duration**: Shows the duration of the last completed water flow
  - Measured in seconds
  - Updates when a flow event completes
  - Helps track water usage patterns

## Supported Languages

This integration supports the following languages:
- English (en)
- Swedish (sv)

The integration will automatically use the language that matches your Home Assistant language settings. All sensor names, states, and UI elements will be displayed in your chosen language.
